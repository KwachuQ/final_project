# Requirements

## General Description
**Theme:** Project management/profiles dashboard - a service to create, update, share, and delete project information (details, attached documents).

## Stack
- **Python 3.12+**
- **FastAPI**
- **PostgreSQL** + Optional ORM (SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- **Docker**
- **AWS S3** (file storage)
- **AWS Lambda** (for image processing, size calculations on S3 event)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Gitlab CI (testing, linting, building, pushing to registry, deploy to cloud on merge request)

## Desired Functionality
- User login / auth
- Create / Delete projects
- Add / Update project’s info/details (name, description)
- Add / Update / Remove project documents (`.docx`, `.pdf`)
- Share project with other users to grant access

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth`: Create user (login, password, repeat password).
- `POST /login`: Login into service (login, password).

### Projects
- `POST /projects`: Create project from details (name, description). Automatically gives access to created project to user, making him the owner (admin of the project).
- `GET /projects`: Get all projects accessible for a user. Returns list of projects' full info (details + documents).
- `GET /project/<project_id>/info`: Return project’s details, if user has access.
- `PUT /project/<project_id>/info`: Update project details (name, description). Returns the updated project’s info.
- `DELETE /project/<project_id>`: Delete project, can only be performed by the project's owner. Deletes the corresponding documents.

### Documents
- `GET /project/<project_id>/documents`: Return all of the project's documents.
- `POST /project/<project_id>/documents`: Upload document(s) for a specific project.
- `GET /document/<document_id>`: Download document, if the user has access to the corresponding project.
- `PUT /document/<document_id>`: Update document.
- `DELETE /document/<document_id>`: Delete document and remove it from the corresponding project.

### Sharing & Invites
- `POST /project/<project_id>/invite?user=<login>`: Grant access to the project for a specific user. If the request is not coming from the owner of the project, results in error. Granting access gives participant permissions to receiving user.
- `GET /project/<project_id>/share?with=<email>`: Send a `GET /join` link with correct hashed token for the requested project to specified email, that can be opened by a different user in a browser.

## Phase 2 Additional Tasks
- Normalization + denormalization of db tables
- Creation of db with and without ORM
- S3 + Lambda: Image resize (optional), calculation of sum of project file's size and apply limit
- Tests, CI&CD bindings
- Package creation, CI&CD bindings, implementation of related tools (`pyproject.toml`, `tox` / `poetry`)
- Validate all data with `pydantic`
- All the business logic requests should be authorized via JWT (including resolving access permissions), issued by `POST /login`. JWT should last 1 hour.

## Implementation Notes
1. All the returned data must be in JSON format (except for file data) + proper HTTP status codes.
2. **2 types of access:** 
   - **Owner:** Creator of the project, can do anything.
   - **Participant:** User invited to the project, can modify, cannot delete.
3. Exact API parameters/endpoints can be changed/updated upon agreement with the mentor, as long as they cover the described logic.
